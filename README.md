Racing-Game
===========

The main objective of this project is to entertain the people and social network. In today's days people are very busy with their job, they don't have time for other activities.
 So I Thought why should not I start the game through which people can entertain and stay in connection of each other.  This both things happen through my software named ‘Car-racing’. We know that people would love to play the game since very earlier, Lot of people have lot of passion about it, that’s why the gaming world gets the success into IT industry.
In these days The social network gets the lot of success. People want to stay in connection. 

So make the software which provides the  both requirement is very innovative. To made this software is quite interesting, passionate to me. 
So how can this software entertain the people with stay connection to each other, Lets go through it in brief. It has two parts
1)  Gaming
2)	Social Network
We have two sections in this software for users to operate on it. 



Gaming Part
By this part user can play the game as a registered/guest user.

How to play game?
1) With this game, user can drive the car on road, After finished the game the best time of user would be calculated and would stored in his/her history. The top gamers would be displayed in this software.
 Registered user can do connect with each other by sending message. A guest user will not have any history but he can play the game only.
In this software we can play the game in two way, first play as registered user and secondly play as Guest user.

If you would play the game as registered user then your history would be saved into database, the history would not be saved if you would play game as a guest user. A guest user can not stay in connection with other registered user also. He gets the permission to play game only.
 In this game the history means the best time of particular user will achieved in total number of game.
The road would be divided into two parts which means user drives the car on first road at very outset, and would go for second road after finished one. The best time would be calculated after ended second road. The best time of particular user would shown after finished the particular game. User can start another game if user wants.

User can select the particular car for particular game, I provided three car for user to select anyone. The user can get the car at right side of window.



Social Network (by messaging)
I provided the feature on this software through which we can know that which are the best gamers till now, An user can do connect with that gamer by sending the message. The particular user has inbox on which he/she can view the message which are sent by other user. The user can do reply of particular message for particular user Or the user can remove this message from his/her's inbox for permanently.
That's how the user/gamer can stay in connection of each other.
So main purpose of this game is 'Be entertain with stay in connection'.
